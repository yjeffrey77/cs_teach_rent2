between LAUSD Community Schools (CS) and comparable traditional LAUSD public schools (TS). One potential reason for this could be methodological.\n\nIn our previous study, we used a 1:1 matching approach, pairing each CS with one TS. This was problematic due to the difficulty of finding TS that truly matched CS.\n\nTo address this, **we decided to compare each community school (cohorts 1-3) with the average retention rate of nearby neighboring schools of the same type, using LAUSD's \"Community of Schools\" as a guide.** For example, an elementary Community School is compared only with traditional public elementary schools within its community of schools, excluding magnets, community day schools, etc.\n\nHence, this HR data includes retention rates for LAUSD Community Schools (cohorts 1-3) and nearby, similar LAUSD public schools.\n\n### Dataset\n\nThis dataset contains a LAUSD Human Resources (HR) data from LAUSD. Some quick facts:\n\n-   Data is taken from 2018 to 2023\n-   Each year contains about 4,500 teachers each year.\n-   There are 158 schools; 47 are considered community schools (CS) through LAUSD's Community School's Initiative, and 111 are traditional LAUSD public schools (TS).\n-   Schools range from 4 to 141 in the number of staff.\n-   Data also includes other variables **such as demographic variables (race/ethnicity, gender, specific job title, and teacher tenure).**\n\nEach LAUSD public school were selected if they had these characteristics:\n\n-   They **are located in the same Community of Schools (COS, a geographic area marked by LAUSD)** for one or more community schools.\n\n-   They **served similar student race/ethnic demographics**.\n\n-   They **served the same grade levels** as one or more community schools. For example, a K-5 LAUSD public school would be selected to serve as a comparison school for one or more community schools within a COS.\n\n-   The LAUSD public school is **within one quintile away in the [Student Needs Equity Index](https://www.lausd.org/Page/17238) (SENI) score from a Community School.** The SENI score is based on a set of academic and community indicators to determine the amount of funds they receive from the district.

We plan to take teacher and staff school-aggregated responses from LAUSD's School Experience Survey (SES).\n\n## Questions\n\n-   What are your thoughts about using the SES items to measure CS implementation fidelity? Are there other ways we can incorporate implementation fidelity into our study?\n\n-   For the regression analyses, should we be concerned about any clustering of the data?\n\n-   Are there any issues with our study design that we should consider?\n\n-   Are there any things we are overlooking or things we need to emphasize in our analyses?\n\n## Appendix\n\n**Number of Staff by School**\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n\nteacher_tbl2<-hr_data_norm_c %>% group_by(cs_binary, school_year, parent_school_name) %>% summarize(\n  n_teacher = n() \n) \n\nteacher_tbl2<-teacher_tbl2 %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = school_year, values_from = n_teacher)\n\n#%>% \n#   select(school_year, `1`, `0`)\n# \n# colnames(teacher_tbl)<-c(\"School Year\", \"CS\",  \"TS\")\n\nteacher_tbl2 %>% kable()\n```\n\n### Information about Each LAUSD Dataset\n\n**CoS_Employee_Retention_HR_Data** - provides all the staff employed on Norm Day 2018 (18-19 school year) at any of the cohort schools you provided. It then follows them over the next 5 years til the this years norm day, so you can see if they left the district or moved to work in other roles/schools.\n\n**CoS_Full_Certificated_Employee_Norm_Day_List** - I clarified with HR and found out that the first file only contained employees if they were present on Norm Day 2018 (i.e., if they first began teaching in, for example, 2020-21, then they would not be in that file.) Because we figured you need all employees at the cohort schools for every year, we requested they also provide the full list of certificated employees for each school year, which is what is in this file.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Purpose\n\nPurposes of this document:\n\n1.

between LAUSD Community Schools (CS) and comparable traditional LAUSD public schools (TS). One potential reason for this could be methodological.\n\nIn our previous study, we used a 1:1 matching approach, pairing each CS with one TS. This was problematic due to the difficulty of finding TS that truly matched CS.\n\nTo address this, **we decided to compare each community school (cohorts 1-3) with the average retention rate of nearby neighboring schools of the same type, using LAUSD's \"Community of Schools\" as a guide.** For example, an elementary Community School is compared only with traditional public elementary schools within its community of schools, excluding magnets, community day schools, etc.\n\nHence, this HR data includes retention rates for LAUSD Community Schools (cohorts 1-3) and nearby, similar LAUSD public schools.\n\n### Dataset\n\nThis dataset contains a LAUSD Human Resources (HR) data from LAUSD. Some quick facts:\n\n-   Data is taken from 2018 to 2023\n-   Each year contains about 4,500 teachers each year.\n-   There are 158 schools; 47 are considered community schools (CS) through LAUSD's Community School's Initiative, and 111 are traditional LAUSD public schools (TS).\n-   Schools range from 4 to 141 in the number of staff.\n-   Data also includes other variables **such as demographic variables (race/ethnicity, gender, specific job title, and teacher tenure).**\n\nEach LAUSD public school were selected if they had these characteristics:\n\n-   They **are located in the same Community of Schools (COS, a geographic area marked by LAUSD)** for one or more community schools.\n\n-   They **served similar student race/ethnic demographics**.\n\n-   They **served the same grade levels** as one or more community schools. For example, a K-5 LAUSD public school would be selected to serve as a comparison school for one or more community schools within a COS.\n\n-   The LAUSD public school is **within one quintile away in the [Student Needs Equity Index](https://www.lausd.org/Page/17238) (SENI) score from a Community School.** The SENI score is based on a set of academic and community indicators to determine the amount of funds they receive from the district. It can be used to measure the level of student need in a school.\n\n**Other Notes:**\n\n-   This HR dataset is a long file. Teacher IDs are repeated several times. There could be a need to transform data to wide data\n\n### Dataset Exploration\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: false\ncolnames(hr_data)\ncolnames(hr_data_norm)\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| eval: false\n\n#hr_data_norm - look at counts\nfor(i in 1:16){\n  colnames(hr_data_norm)[i] %>% print()\n  hr_data_norm %>% count(get(colnames(hr_data_norm)[i])) %>% print()\n}\n```\n\n#### Overall\n\n**Number of Staff in Comparison and Community Schools**\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n\nteacher_tbl<-hr_data_norm_c %>% group_by(cs_binary, school_year) %>% summarize(\n  n_teacher = n() \n) \n\nteacher_tbl<-teacher_tbl %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = cs_binary, values_from = n_teacher) %>% \n  select(school_year, `1`, `0`)\n\ncolnames(teacher_tbl)<-c(\"School Year\", \"CS\",  \"TS\")\n\nteacher_tbl %>% kable()\n```\n\n**Number of Schools by Community Schools and Comparison Schools**\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n\nsch_tbl<-hr_data_norm_c %>% group_by(cs_binary, school_year, parent_school_name) %>% summarize(\n  n_teacher_by_sch = n()\n)\n\nsch_tbl<-sch_tbl %>% group_by(cs_binary, school_year) %>% \n  summarize(\n    n_sch = n()\n  )\n\nsch_tbl<-sch_tbl %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = cs_binary, values_from = n_sch) %>% \n  select(school_year, `1`, `0`)\n\ncolnames(sch_tbl)<-c(\"School Year\", \"CS\",  \"TS\")\n\nsch_tbl %>% kable()\n```\n\n#### By Neighborhood\n\n**Number of Community and Comparison Schools**\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n\ncos_sch_tbl<-hr_data_norm_c %>% group_by(cs_binary, school_year,cos, parent_school_name) %>% summarize(\n  n_teacher_by_sch = n()\n)\n\ncos_sch_tbl<-cos_sch_tbl %>% group_by(cs_binary, school_year, cos) %>%\n  summarize(\n    n_sch = n()\n  )\n\ncos_sch_tbl1<-cos_sch_tbl %>% filter(cs_binary == 1) %>%\n  ungroup() %>% select(-c(cs_binary))\n\ncos_sch_tbl0<-cos_sch_tbl %>% filter(cs_binary == 0) %>%\n  ungroup() %>% select(-c(cs_binary))\n\ncos_sch_tbl<-left_join(cos_sch_tbl1,cos_sch_tbl0,\n                   by = c(\"school_year\",\"cos\"))\n\ncolnames(cos_sch_tbl)<-c(\"School Year\", \"Community of School\",  \"CS\", \"TS\")\n\ncos_sch_tbl<-cos_sch_tbl %>% pivot_wider(names_from = `School Year`,\n                  values_from = c(CS, TS)) %>% \n  select(\n    \"Community of School\",\n    \"CS_2023-24\",\"TS_2023-24\")\n\n\ncolnames(cos_sch_tbl)<-c(\"School Year\", \"CS\",  \"TS\")\n\ncos_sch_tbl %>% kable()\n```\n\n**Number of Teachers**\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n\ncos_tbl<-hr_data_norm_c %>% group_by(cs_binary, school_year, cos) %>% summarize(\n  n_teacher = n()\n)\n\ncos_tbl1<-cos_tbl %>% filter(cs_binary == 1) %>%\n  ungroup() %>% select(-c(cs_binary))\n\ncos_tbl0<-cos_tbl %>% filter(cs_binary == 0) %>%\n  ungroup() %>% select(-c(cs_binary))\n\ncos_tbl<-left_join(cos_tbl1,cos_tbl0,\n                   by = c(\"school_year\",\"cos\"))\n\ncolnames(cos_tbl)<-c(\"School Year\", \"Community of School\",  \"CS\", \"TS\")\n\ncos_tbl<-cos_tbl %>% pivot_wider(names_from = `School Year`,\n                  values_from = c(CS, TS)) %>% \n  select(\n    \"Community of School\",\n    \"CS_2018-19\",\"TS_2018-19\",\n    \"CS_2019-20\",\"TS_2019-20\",\n    \"CS_2020-21\",\"TS_2020-21\",\n    \"CS_2021-22\",\"TS_2021-22\",\n    \"CS_2022-23\",\"TS_2022-23\",\n    \"CS_2023-24\",\"TS_2023-24\")\n\ncos_tbl %>% kable()\n```\n\n## Power Analysis (for T-Test)\n\n### Two-Sided T-test\n\nCohen suggests that d values of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 represent small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively.\n\n**Overall**\n\n```{r}\n\nextract_pwr_output <- function(n1, n2, d, sig.level, power) {\n  \nresult <- pwr.t2n.test(n1 = n1, n2 = n2, d = d,\n                       sig.level = sig.level, power = power)\n\n  # Convert the result to a dataframe\nresult[[\"n1\"]]<-ceiling(result[[\"n1\"]])\n\nresult_df <- data.frame(result[[\"n1\"]],result[[\"n2\"]],result[[\"d\"]],\n                        result[[\"sig.level\"]],\n                        result[[\"power\"]],result[[\"alternative\"]],\n                        result[[\"method\"]])\n\ncolnames(result_df)<-c(\"n1\",\"n2\",\"d\",\"sig.level\",\n                       \"power\", \"alternative\", \"method\")\n\nreturn(result_df)\n    \n}\n\nsmall<-extract_pwr_output(n1 = NULL, n2= 3000, d = 0.2,\n             sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.8)\nmedium<-extract_pwr_output(n1 = NULL, n2= 3000, d = 0.5,\n             sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.8)\nlarge<-extract_pwr_output(n1 = NULL, n2= 3000, d = 0.9,\n             sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.8)\n\noverall_pwr_tbl<-rbind(small,medium,large)\n\noverall_pwr_tbl %>% kable()\n\n\n```\n\n**To detect a small, medium, and large effect, we would need a 211, 32, and 10 community school staff, respectively.

We plan to take teacher and staff school-aggregated responses from LAUSD's School Experience Survey (SES).\n\n## Questions\n\n-   What are your thoughts about using the SES items to measure CS implementation fidelity? Are there other ways we can incorporate implementation fidelity into our study?\n\n-   For the regression analyses, should we be concerned about any clustering of the data?\n\n-   Are there any issues with our study design that we should consider?\n\n-   Are there any things we are overlooking or things we need to emphasize in our analyses?\n\n## Appendix\n\n**Number of Staff by School**\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n\nteacher_tbl2<-hr_data_norm_c %>% group_by(cs_binary, school_year, parent_school_name) %>% summarize(\n  n_teacher = n() \n) \n\nteacher_tbl2<-teacher_tbl2 %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = school_year, values_from = n_teacher)\n\n#%>% \n#   select(school_year, `1`, `0`)\n# \n# colnames(teacher_tbl)<-c(\"School Year\", \"CS\",  \"TS\")\n\nteacher_tbl2 %>% kable()\n```\n\n### Information about Each LAUSD Dataset\n\n**CoS_Employee_Retention_HR_Data** - provides all the staff employed on Norm Day 2018 (18-19 school year) at any of the cohort schools you provided. It then follows them over the next 5 years til the this years norm day, so you can see if they left the district or moved to work in other roles/schools.\n\n**CoS_Full_Certificated_Employee_Norm_Day_List** - I clarified with HR and found out that the first file only contained employees if they were present on Norm Day 2018 (i.e., if they first began teaching in, for example, 2020-21, then they would not be in that file.) Because we figured you need all employees at the cohort schools for every year, we requested they also provide the full list of certificated employees for each school year, which is what is in this
